## COURSE MOTIVATION
Numerical linear algebra including solution of systems of equations and eigenvalue problems and numerical solution of ordinary/partial differential equations by finite difference methods. Credit will not be awarded for MEGR 7172 where credit has been awarded for MEGR 8172.


## TEXTBOOK
*Python Programming and Numerical Methods*

Qingkai Kong, Timmy Siauw, and Alexandre M. Bayen.

This textbook is free to download through UNCC library website.

## COURSE OUTCOMES

The objective of this course is to provide the students with an understanding of computational methods:

- Fundamental Python Programming
- Numerical integration/Gradient Calculation
- Interpolation
- Fundamental linear algebra,
- Systems of equations and linear regression 
- Optimizations
- Root finding and partial differential equations
- Error analysis

It is likely that some topics won't be covered due to the time restriction.
