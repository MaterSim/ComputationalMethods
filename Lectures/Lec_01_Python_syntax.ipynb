If you don't have one, you can create one for free.\n","- Create a new notebook: Once you're signed in, you can create a new notebook by clicking on \"New notebook\".\n","\n","In our course, we will stick to the use of Colab throughout the class.\n","If you have a laptop, bring it laptop to class and follow the instruction to run the codes via Colab. Otherwise, do excercises after the class.\n","\n","### 1.1.2 Local installation\n","While Colab provides excellent environment, we strongly recommend you also setup the Python on your own local environment.
